        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a great hamburger for the grill. Feta cheese gives 
            it a rich and creamy taste.
        </p>        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li>Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly 
                    oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, 
                    parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture 
                    into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties. 
                    Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each of four of
                    the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese with 
                    one of the patties without; press the edges together 
                    to seal the cheese into the center.</li>
                <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are 
                    cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 
                    minutes per side for well done. An instant-read 
                    thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 
                    degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            </ol>
